# [Example 2] Uss register using ModAPI, semi-automatic mode

In case when you do not want to create yout custom Main.py script, you can use this tool.

Just create <somename>.xml file in PnFMods/USSHelper/FMods/uss directory and paste there something like following:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<uss>
    <file path="../ubbound/flash/item2.swf"/>
    <file path="../ubbound/flash/item456.swf"/>
</uss>
```

BE CAREFULL, gui/flash DIRECTORY SHOULD EXIST, BECAUSE MODAPI HAS NO ABILITY TO CREATE DIRECTORIES
